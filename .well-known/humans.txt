/* PROJECT INFO */

Project Name: Evidence Graph for Investigative Journalism
Short Name: bofig
Repository: https://github.com/Hyperpolymath/bofig
Website: https://evidencegraph.org (Phase 2+)
Status: Phase 1 (PoC) - Month 1 of 18
First Commit: 2025-11-22
Current Version: 0.1.0

Purpose: Infrastructure for pragmatic epistemology in investigative journalism

Core Concepts:
- i-docs navigation (navigation over narration)
- PROMPT framework (6-dimensional epistemological scoring)
- Boundary objects (multiple audience perspectives on same evidence)

Tagline: "We didn't fall from Truth to Post-Truth; we evolved to complex epistemology without building infrastructure. This system IS that infrastructure."

/* TECHNICAL DETAILS */

Backend: Elixir 1.16+ with Phoenix 1.7+
Frontend: Phoenix LiveView + D3.js (progressive enhancement)
Database: ArangoDB 3.11+ (multi-model: document + graph)
API: GraphQL via Absinthe
Testing: ExUnit, Wallaby (future)
CI/CD: GitLab CI / GitHub Actions
Hosting (Phase 2): Hetzner Cloud (EU data sovereignty)

Architecture: See ARCHITECTURE.md for 4,000-word deep-dive
Roadmap: See ROADMAP.md for 18-month plan

/* GOVERNANCE */

Model: Tri-Perimeter Contribution Framework (TPCF)
Current Perimeter: P3 (Community Sandbox) - open contribution
Code of Conduct: CCCP (Community-Centric Code of Practice)
Emotional Temperature: ✅ Healthy (see MAINTAINERS.md for metrics)
Decision Making: RFC process for major changes, consensus-driven
Reversibility: 90-day contribution withdrawal window (Palimpsest License)

/* PHILOSOPHY */

This isn't just a database. It's infrastructure for **coordinating without consensus**.

Every design choice asks:
1. Does this support multiple audience perspectives?
2. Does this make epistemology measurable?
3. Does this enable navigation over narration?

We prioritize:
- Evidence over opinion
- Transparency over obfuscation
- Emotional safety over "move fast and break things"
- Journalist needs over tech trends

/* GRATITUDE */

To investigative journalists worldwide who risk their safety to uncover truth:
This tool is for you. Thank you for your work.

To open source maintainers who burn out so others can build:
This project uses Palimpsest License to protect your well-being.

To everyone who contributed to human knowledge, whether or not you got credit:
We see you. We value you. We're trying to build better infrastructure.
