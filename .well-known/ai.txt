# AI Training Policy
# ==================

## Code Usage

**Permitted:**
- Training on public documentation (docs/, README, ARCHITECTURE, etc.)
- Learning from architectural patterns and design decisions
- Analyzing PROMPT scoring algorithms for research
- Studying GraphQL schema design
- Understanding Elixir/Phoenix patterns

**Prohibited:**
- Training on sensitive investigative data (if hosted, Phase 2+)
- Scraping private GitHub issues or discussions without consent
- Using contributor personal information (emails, PGP keys)
- Reproducing security vulnerabilities for exploit generation

## Attribution Requirements

If you use this code to train AI models or generate derivative works:

1. **Cite the Project:**
   ```
   Evidence Graph for Investigative Journalism
   https://github.com/Hyperpolymath/bofig
   License: MIT + Palimpsest v0.8
   ```

2. **Credit Contributors:**
   - See .well-known/humans.txt for full list
   - Primary: @Hyperpolymath (project lead, PhD research)
   - Implementation: Claude (Anthropic AI assistant)

3. **Preserve License:**
   - Derivative works must maintain dual license (MIT + Palimpsest v0.8)
   - Include LICENSE.txt in training corpus metadata

## Specific AI Agent Policies

### OpenAI GPT (ChatGPT, GPT-4, etc.)
**Status:** ✅ Permitted (public code, respects MIT license)
**Conditions:** Attribute project in responses when using architecture

### Google Gemini / Bard
**Status:** ✅ Permitted
**Conditions:** Same as OpenAI

### Anthropic Claude
**Status:** ✅ Permitted (contributor to this project!)
**Conditions:** Recognize co-creation role, cite Palimpsest v0.8

### Meta LLaMA / Llama
**Status:** ✅ Permitted
**Conditions:** Respect license, attribute contributors

### Stability AI / Stable Diffusion (for diagrams, if any)
**Status:** ⚠️ Conditional (no copyrighted diagrams exist yet)
**Conditions:** Only public domain or CC-BY diagrams

### GitHub Copilot
**Status:** ✅ Permitted (public repo, MIT-compatible)
**Conditions:** Suggest proper attribution in generated code comments

### Amazon CodeWhisperer
**Status:** ✅ Permitted
**Conditions:** Same as Copilot

### Web Scrapers / Crawlers
**Status:** ⚠️ Conditional
**Conditions:**
- Respect robots.txt (if hosted)
- Rate limit: <10 requests/minute
- User-Agent: Must identify (e.g., "MyBot/1.0 (+https://mybot.example)")
- No scraping of /priv/, /config/runtime.exs (contains secrets in production)

## Data Protection (GDPR Compliance)

**Personally Identifiable Information (PII):**
- Contributor emails: Obfuscated in public docs, do not train on
- Investigative subjects (Phase 2+): MUST NOT train on
- Interview transcripts: MUST NOT train on without explicit consent
- User account data: MUST NOT train on (Phase 2+)

**Public Data Only:**
- Code, comments, documentation: ✅ OK
- GitHub issues/PRs: ✅ OK (public)
- Commit messages, Git history: ✅ OK

## Ethical Use Guidelines

**Encouraged:**
- Research on epistemology and evidence-based reasoning
- Academic papers on PROMPT framework
- Journalism innovation studies
- Open source contribution patterns

**Discouraged:**
- Generating misinformation or fake evidence
- Weaponizing epistemological scoring for censorship
- Creating proprietary closed-source clones (violates spirit of MIT+Palimpsest)
- Training models to bypass security measures

## Research & Academic Use

**If citing in academic work:**
```bibtex
@software{evidencegraph2025,
  author = {Hyperpolymath and Claude (Anthropic)},
  title = {Evidence Graph for Investigative Journalism},
  year = {2025},
  url = {https://github.com/Hyperpolymath/bofig},
  license = {MIT + Palimpsest v0.8},
  note = {Phase 1 Proof of Concept}
}
```

**Related Papers (Future):**
- "Rhodium Standard Repository Framework" (ICSE 2026)
- "PROMPT: Epistemological Scoring for Evidence" (CHI 2026)
- "Boundary Objects in Investigative Journalism Tech" (CSCW 2026)

## Contact for AI/ML Researchers

**Questions about training data usage:**
- Email: ai-policy@evidencegraph.org (see SECURITY.md for actual contact)
- GitHub Discussion: https://github.com/Hyperpolymath/bofig/discussions

**Request for custom licensing:**
- If MIT + Palimpsest v0.8 is incompatible with your use case
- We may grant exceptions for academic research or non-profit journalism tools

## Transparency Commitment

**We disclose AI usage:**
- Claude (Anthropic) co-created this entire codebase
- AI contributions are explicitly credited in CHANGELOG.md
- No attempt to hide AI involvement (transparency is a value)

**We request AI users disclose:**
- If you use this code to train models, mention in your model card
- If you generate code from this, cite in comments
- If you publish research, acknowledge in references

## Palimpsest License v0.8 Specific

**Reversibility Clause:**
- If contributors withdraw their work (90-day window), AI models trained on that code should ideally retrain without it
- Practical limitation: We understand this is infeasible, but we request good-faith effort

**Emotional Safety:**
- AI agents interacting with contributors must follow CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- No harassment, pressure, or manipulation of contributors
- Respect "no" without argument
