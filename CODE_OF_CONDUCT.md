### Conflict Resolution

**Before escalating to enforcement:**

1. **Direct Communication**: Try to resolve privately (if safe)
2. **Mediation**: Request a neutral third party (P2 contributor)
3. **Cooling-Off Period**: Take a break, revisit later
4. **Documentation**: Write out your perspective (helps clarify)

**When to escalate immediately:**
- Threats, doxxing, or harassment
- Discrimination or hate speech
- Repeated boundary violations
- Safety concerns

## Maintainer Responsibilities

### Leading by Example

Maintainers must:
- Model respectful behavior
- Respond to reports promptly and fairly
- Enforce Code of Conduct consistently
- Protect reporter confidentiality
- Avoid conflicts of interest (recuse if needed)

### Transparency

- Enforcement decisions documented in MAINTAINERS.md (anonymized)
- Community informed of pattern trends (not individual cases)
- Annual Code of Conduct review with community input

### Self-Care

Maintainers are also protected:
- Can take breaks without guilt
- May delegate enforcement to trusted parties
- Have same reversibility rights as contributors

## Community Responsibilities

**Everyone** can contribute to a healthy community:

- **Welcome newcomers**: Respond to "beginner" questions kindly
- **Assume best intentions**: Miscommunication is common, malice is rare
- **Call in, not out**: Address issues privately first when possible
- **Support each other**: Check in on contributors, celebrate wins
- **Respect maintainer boundaries**: They're volunteers too
